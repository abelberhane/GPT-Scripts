# Fighting Game Community TV Program
This repository will contain a program to be hosted on televisions through the venue to display the fighters and clips of them similar to boxers before a match.

### The Challenge
I wanted to develop the program I want with as much help as I could from GPT. On my first iteration I was able to get pretty close but now I have to work on iterating my requests and finding the right verbiage to
have the AI do the work for me. 

### Looking Back
To be determined
