# Role-Prompting with GitHub Copilot

## Overview
This folder/repository is dedicated to showcasing and exploring the functionalities of role-prompting with GitHub Copilot. Role-prompting involves giving specific context or a "role" to the AI, guiding it to generate code, comments, or documentation in a manner consistent with that role. With GitHub Copilot's AI pair programming capabilities, role-prompting can lead to more precise, context-aware code suggestions and a smoother development workflow.

### Repository Contents
- `./examples/`: A directory containing example scripts and projects where role-prompting has been applied.
- `./docs/`: Documentation on role-prompting strategies, best practices, and how GitHub Copilot understands and responds to role-based prompts.
- `./tests/`: Test cases and scripts to demonstrate the efficacy of role-prompting in achieving more accurate and context-aware code with GitHub Copilot.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to this repository.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Rules and expected behavior for community interactions.

## Prerequisites
- **GitHub Account**: You'll need a GitHub account to access GitHub Copilot. [Sign up](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one.
- **Visual Studio Code**: GitHub Copilot works with Microsoftâ€™s Visual Studio Code editor. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you haven't already.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Access to GitHub Copilot, currently available as a technical preview. You can join the waitlist [here](https://copilot.github.com/).

## Setup
1. **Install GitHub Copilot on VS Code**: Once you have access, install the GitHub Copilot plugin for VS Code. The installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/github/copilot-docs/blob/main/setup.md).
2. **Configure Settings**: If there are specific settings or configurations you prefer with VS Code or Copilot, set those up accordingly. More on Copilot settings can be found in the [official documentation](https://github.com/github/copilot-docs).

## Usage
To use role-prompting with GitHub Copilot, you'll need to structure your comments or docstrings in a way that effectively communicates the "role" you want the AI to play. This could be a specific type of developer, a focus on a certain type of code, or a style of coding. 

Example:
```python
# Role: Write this function as if you are a Python developer focused on data security. 
# It should securely handle user authentication using password hashing.
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # ...
```
After writing a role-prompt, invoke GitHub Copilot (Ctrl + Enter or Cmd + Enter for Mac) to receive a suggestion that aims to align with the provided context.

Explore the `./examples/` directory to understand how role-prompts can be written for different scenarios and observe GitHub Copilot's responses.
