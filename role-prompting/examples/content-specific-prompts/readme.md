# Content-Specific Prompts Directory

Welcome to the `content-specific-prompts` directory! Here, you'll find a collection of examples that demonstrate the power and precision of content-specific role-prompts in guiding GitHub Copilot to generate code tailored to very specific requirements or content domains.

These examples go beyond general programming tasks, showing how GitHub Copilot can handle scenarios where domain-specific knowledge, specific content formats, or particular data structures are essential. Each sub-directory focuses on a unique content domain, illustrating how accurately formulated role-prompts lead to more context-aware code generation.

## Included Domains

1. **ScientificComputing**: Examples of prompts that specify requirements for scientific calculations, data processing, or simulations, and how GitHub Copilot generates code that adheres to scientific accuracy and standards.

2. **NaturalLanguageProcessing**: Prompts that direct GitHub Copilot to perform tasks requiring understanding, manipulation, or generation of human language data, illustrating its use in complex, nuanced scenarios.

3. **Engineering Professions**: Prompts that relate to a specific engineering profession, whether it be QA, DBA or any other type

Each sub-directory contains its own README that explains the specific domain, the role-prompt used, and a detailed breakdown of the resulting code and its relevance to the specified content area.

## How to Use

To dive into these examples:

1. Choose the sub-directory that corresponds to the content domain you're interested in.
2. Open the README file in the sub-directory to understand the domain, the role-prompt, and the intention behind the provided code.
3. Study the provided code to see how the role-prompt influenced GitHub Copilot's output, particularly paying attention to the handling of domain-specific elements.
4. If applicable, run the code to observe its functionality in real-time. Ensure you follow any provided instructions or requirements listed in the README.

## Contributing

Contributions to expand or enhance these examples are welcome! When submitting a pull request, please include a comprehensive README in your sub-directory, detailing the domain-specific role-prompt, a description of the code, and any necessary background information or references.

## Feedback

We value your feedback! If you have comments, questions, or issues to report relating to any examples, please use the repository's issues section. Include the name of the domain and example in the issue title for clarity.
