# DataManipulation

## Overview

The `DataManipulation/` directory contains examples that demonstrate how role-prompting with GitHub Copilot can influence the generation of code for data manipulation tasks. These examples cover various aspects of data manipulation, such as reading data from files, processing data structures, and performing common data operations. The examples are crafted to illustrate how role-prompts can lead to different coding styles, methodologies, and efficiencies in handling data.

### Contents

- `read_csv_python.py`: A Python script to read data from a CSV file, showcasing the influence of role-prompts on handling file operations and data parsing.
   - In this script, the role-prompt specifies the creation of a Python script that reads data from a CSV file both efficiently and safely, with clear comments for educational purposes.
   - The script starts by importing necessary modules, then defines a read_csv_file function that reads data from a CSV file using Python's built-in csv module, handling potential exceptions along the way.
   - The script uses context management (with statement) for file operations to ensure resources are managed efficiently, and csv.DictReader to read the CSV file, converting each row into a dictionary for easier data manipulation.
   - The main function serves as the entry point for the script, which is invoked if the script is run as the main program. This script is a hypothetical example demonstrating how one might structure a CSV reading functionality in Python and the type of code GitHub Copilot might suggest based on the role-prompt. The actual suggestions from GitHub Copilot may vary based on the prompt and the specifics of the code context provided.


- `json_manipulation_javascript.js`: A JavaScript file illustrating data manipulation with JSON, influenced by role-prompting.
   - In this script, the role-prompt specifies the task of creating a JavaScript function that can parse a JSON string, handle potential errors during parsing, and perform some form of manipulation on the parsed data, all while being beginner-friendly and thoroughly commented.
   - The parseAndManipulateJSON function in this script first tries to parse a provided JSON string. If parsing is successful, it checks if the resulting data is an array of objects or a single object, then performs a simple data manipulation example: adding a new property to each object. If the JSON format is unexpected, it logs an error. The main function showcases how you might use parseAndManipulateJSON with a sample JSON string.
   - Please note that this script serves as a hypothetical example of how one might structure a JSON manipulation task in JavaScript and the type of code GitHub Copilot might generate in response to the role-prompt. 

- `data_filtering_ruby.rb`: A Ruby script demonstrating data filtering operations on an array of hashes, with role-prompt variations.
   - In this data_filtering_ruby.rb script, the role-prompt is asking for a Ruby script that performs data filtering on an array of hashes, with a focus on efficiency, readability, and robustness against data inconsistencies.
   - The script defines a PEOPLE constant, which is an array of hashes where each hash represents an individual person's data. There's an intentional data inconsistency introduced in the data of "Laura" to showcase how the script handles such cases.
   - The filter_people_by_city method filters the PEOPLE array based on a specified city. It uses the select method to return an array containing only the people from the specified city and checks that the age is an Integer (to handle the "unknown" age case).
   - The main method is the entry point of the script, which calls filter_people_by_city with "San Francisco" as an argument and prints out the filtered data.
   - This script and the role-prompt are hypothetical examples meant to demonstrate how one might structure such a task in Ruby and the type of code GitHub Copilot might suggest in response to the prompt. 

- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading, which provides an overview and guidance on how to utilize the data manipulation examples.

## Logic and Goals

Data manipulation is a common task in software development, involving operations such as parsing, transforming, filtering, and aggregating data. These operations can often be performed in various ways, each with its own implications for performance, readability, and code complexity. The examples in this directory aim to demonstrate how role-prompting with GitHub Copilot can affect the way these tasks are approached and implemented in code.

Each script in this directory comes with a role-prompt that specifies certain criteria or goals, such as maximizing efficiency, ensuring readability for beginners, or using specific programming paradigms or methodologies. The code generated by GitHub Copilot in response to these prompts shows how the AI understands and executes the task based on the provided context and objectives.

By studying and experimenting with these examples, users can gain insights into how different priorities can change the approach to coding solutions, and how GitHub Copilot adapts its suggestions based on the nuances of each role-prompt.

## Using These Examples

To use these examples, follow these steps:

1. **Select an Example**: Choose an example that aligns with your interests or the specific concept you wish to explore.
   
2. **Understand the Role-Prompt**: Before diving into the code, read the role-prompt that precedes it. This prompt sets the context and objectives for the code that follows.

3. **Analyze the Code**: Examine how GitHub Copilot has responded to the role-prompt in the code. Consider the techniques, functions, and structures used, and how they align with the goals set by the role-prompt.

4. **Modify and Experiment**: For deeper understanding and exploration, alter the role-prompts or the code itself, and use GitHub Copilot to see how different prompts or coding criteria influence the suggested solutions.
