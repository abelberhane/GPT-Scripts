# DataManipulation

## Overview

The `DataManipulation/` directory contains examples that demonstrate how role-prompting with GitHub Copilot can influence the generation of code for data manipulation tasks. These examples cover various aspects of data manipulation, such as reading data from files, processing data structures, and performing common data operations. The examples are crafted to illustrate how role-prompts can lead to different coding styles, methodologies, and efficiencies in handling data.

### Contents

- `read_csv_python.py`: A Python script to read data from a CSV file, showcasing the influence of role-prompts on handling file operations and data parsing.
- `json_manipulation_javascript.js`: A JavaScript file illustrating data manipulation with JSON, influenced by role-prompting.
- `data_filtering_ruby.rb`: A Ruby script demonstrating data filtering operations on an array of hashes, with role-prompt variations.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading, which provides an overview and guidance on how to utilize the data manipulation examples.

## Logic and Goals

Data manipulation is a common task in software development, involving operations such as parsing, transforming, filtering, and aggregating data. These operations can often be performed in various ways, each with its own implications for performance, readability, and code complexity. The examples in this directory aim to demonstrate how role-prompting with GitHub Copilot can affect the way these tasks are approached and implemented in code.

Each script in this directory comes with a role-prompt that specifies certain criteria or goals, such as maximizing efficiency, ensuring readability for beginners, or using specific programming paradigms or methodologies. The code generated by GitHub Copilot in response to these prompts shows how the AI understands and executes the task based on the provided context and objectives.

By studying and experimenting with these examples, users can gain insights into how different priorities can change the approach to coding solutions, and how GitHub Copilot adapts its suggestions based on the nuances of each role-prompt.

## Using These Examples

To use these examples, follow these steps:

1. **Select an Example**: Choose an example that aligns with your interests or the specific concept you wish to explore.
   
2. **Understand the Role-Prompt**: Before diving into the code, read the role-prompt that precedes it. This prompt sets the context and objectives for the code that follows.

3. **Analyze the Code**: Examine how GitHub Copilot has responded to the role-prompt in the code. Consider the techniques, functions, and structures used, and how they align with the goals set by the role-prompt.

4. **Modify and Experiment**: For deeper understanding and exploration, alter the role-prompts or the code itself, and use GitHub Copilot to see how different prompts or coding criteria influence the suggested solutions.
