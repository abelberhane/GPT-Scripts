# HelloWorldWithRolePrompt

## Overview

The `HelloWorldWithRolePrompt/` directory contains simplistic examples demonstrating the "Hello, World!" program across various programming languages using role-prompting with GitHub Copilot. The primary objective here is to show how even with a basic program, role-prompting can subtly change the output based on the context, style, or specific instructions given to Copilot.

### Contents

- `hello_world_python.py`: A Python version of "Hello, World!" with role-prompting.
- `hello_world_javascript.js`: A JavaScript iteration of "Hello, World!" influenced by role-prompting.
- `hello_world_ruby.rb`: "Hello, World!" in Ruby, showcasing role-prompt guidance.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading.

## Logic and Goals

The "Hello, World!" program is traditionally the first step for anyone learning a new programming language. It's simple, straightforward, and serves as an introduction to the syntax and structure of a language. Here, however, we're taking it a step further to introduce the concept of role-prompting with GitHub Copilot.

The idea is to use role-prompting to alter the way the "Hello, World!" output is generated or displayed, showcasing that even with a program as simple as this, the context provided to GitHub Copilot can change the code it suggests. 

For instance, a role-prompt might request that the program is written with a focus on memory efficiency, or that it's styled in a way that's suitable for beginner comprehension, or that it includes error-handling (even though that's uncommon for a simple "Hello, World!" program). 

By comparing the different files in this directory, you'll see how the language used in the role-prompt can influence the code generated by Copilot, even though the end goal (printing "Hello, World!" to the console) remains constant.

## Using These Examples

To use these examples, follow these steps:

1. **Open an Example**: Open any of the provided script files in this directory in Visual Studio Code.
   
2. **Read the Role-Prompt**: At the top of each file, there's a comment with the role-prompt. This is the instruction provided to GitHub Copilot.

3. **Check Copilot's Response**: Below the role-prompt, the code is written as suggested by GitHub Copilot. Notice how it might differ from a standard "Hello, World!" program in that language due to the role-prompt.

4. **Modify and Experiment**: Change the role-prompts in the provided examples, or create a new file with a different role-prompt, and then invoke GitHub Copilot to see how the suggestions vary. 

Remember, the goal isn't just to print "Hello, World!" but to understand how different prompts can lead to different coding styles, structures, and practices.
