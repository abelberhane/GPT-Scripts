# Basic Examples: Role-Prompting with GitHub Copilot

## Overview

Welcome to the `basic-examples/` directory! This section is designed for individuals who are new to role-prompting with GitHub Copilot or those looking to understand its fundamental capabilities. The examples provided here are simple, straightforward, and cover a range of common scenarios to illustrate how role-prompting can influence the AI's code suggestions.

Whether you're new to GitHub Copilot or are an experienced developer curious about the concept of role-prompting, these examples will give you a clear understanding of how to start integrating role-based prompts into your coding workflow.

- `DataManipulation/`: Basic examples of data manipulation scripts, illustrating how different role-prompts can lead to different approaches in handling data.
- `ControlStructures/`: Examples focusing on loops, conditionals, and other control structures, showing how role-prompts can alter the logic presented by GitHub Copilot.
- `ErrorHandling/`: See how role-prompting can influence the way GitHub Copilot suggests error-handling mechanisms.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading, which provides an overview and guidance on how to use the basic examples.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose an Example**: Start by selecting an example that interests you or is relevant to your current learning path. Each example is contained in its own directory with a descriptive name.

2. **Read the Role-Prompt**: For each example, the role-prompt is provided in the form of a comment or docstring at the top of the code. This is the instruction that was given to GitHub Copilot.

3. **Examine the Code**: Below the role-prompt, you'll see the code that GitHub Copilot generated in response. Consider how closely the code aligns with the expectations set by the role-prompt.

4. **Modify and Experiment**: To get the most out of these examples, modify the role-prompts and observe how the suggestions change. Try to understand why Copilot responds the way it does to certain prompts.

## How to Use These Examples

These examples are crafted to be as straightforward as possible, so you don't need a deep understanding of the technology to get started. Follow these steps:

1. **Open the Example in VS Code**: Since GitHub Copilot operates in Visual Studio Code, you'll need to open these example files in that environment. You can clone the whole repository or just copy the content into a new file in VS Code.

2. **Activate GitHub Copilot**: Make sure GitHub Copilot is activated and ready to assist you in your VS Code environment. You can invoke it by pressing `Ctrl` + `Space` (or `Cmd` + `Space` on a Mac) or it might activate automatically as you start typing after a role-prompt.

3. **Experiment with Prompts**: Change the existing prompts in the examples or write your own, then request suggestions from GitHub Copilot. This is the best way to learn!

4. **Reflect on the Code**: Think about how the suggestions align with best practices, efficiency, readability, and other coding standards. Remember, Copilot's suggestions are based on the code it's been trained on, and they require a developer's review.
